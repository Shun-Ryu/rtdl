> 1. This repository is **NOT** deprecated.
> 2. However, the package `rtdl`
>    is deprecated and replaced with individual packages.
> 3. If you used the latest `rtdl==0.0.13` installed from PyPI (not from GitHub!)
>    as `pip install rtdl`, then the same models
>    (MLP, ResNet, FT-Transformer) can be found in the `rtdl_revisiting_models` package,
>    though API is slightly different.
> 4. :exclamation: **If you used the unfinished code from the main branch, it is highly**
>    **recommended to switch to the new packages.** In particular,
>    the unfinished implementation of embeddings for continuous features
>    contained many unresolved issues (the new `rtdl_num_embeddings` package, in turn,
>    is more efficient and correct).
